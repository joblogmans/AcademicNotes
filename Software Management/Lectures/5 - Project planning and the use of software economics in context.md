When to create the project plan:
- At the proposal stage (bidding stage)
- During project startup phase (who does what, iterations, resource allocation, etc.)
- Periodically throughout the project (when you modify the plan based on the progress/experiences so far)

### Proposal planning
- Planning may be necessary with only outline software requirements
- Aim is to provide info that will be used in setting a price for the customers
- Usually mandatory when responding to any request for proposal (RfP)

### Software pricing
There is not a simple relationship between the development cost and the price charged. Some factors:

| Factor | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Market opportunity | A development organization may quote a low price because it wishes to move into a new segment of the software market. Accepting a low profit on one project may give the organization the opportunity to make a greater profit later. The experience gained may also help it develop new products. |
| Cost estimate uncertainty | If an organization is unsure of its cost estimate, it may increase its price by a contingency over and above its normal profit. |
| Contractual terms | A customer may be willing to allow the developer to retain ownership of the source code and reuse it in other projects. The price charged may then be less than if the software source code is handed over to the customer. |
| Requirements volatility | If the requirements are likely to change, an organization may lower its price to win a contract. After the contract is awarded, high prices can be charged for changes to the requirements. |
| Financial health | Developers in financial difficulty may lower their price to gain a contract. It is better to make a smaller than normal profit or break even than to go out of business. Cash flow is more important than profit in difficult economic times. |

## Plan-driven development
A development approach where the development process is planned in detail. A project plan is created that records the work to be done, who will do it, the development schedule and the work products. Managers use the plan to support project decision making and as a way of measuring progress.

Early planning allows for staff availability, company planning, potential problems and dependencies to be discovered before the project starts.

However, many decisions will have to be revised because of changes to the environment in which the software is developed and used.

### Project plan sections:
- Introduction
- Project organization
- Risk analysis
- Hardware and software resource requirements
- Work breakdown structure
- Project schedule
- Monitoring and reporting mechanisms

Possible supplements:

| Plan | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Quality plan | Describes the quality procedures and standards that will be used in a project. |
| Validation plan | Describes the approach, resources, and schedule used for system validation. |
| Configuration management plan | Describes the configuration management procedures and structures to be used. |
| Maintenance plan | Predicts the maintenance requirements, costs, and effort. |
| Staff development plan | Describes how the skills and experience of the project team members will be developed. |

## Scheduling problems
- Estimating the difficulty of problems is hard -> cost estimation is hard.
- Productivity is not proportional to the number of people working on a task.
- Adding people to a late project makes it later because of the communication overheads.
- The unexpected always happens. Always allow contingency in planning.

## Agile planning
Plan-driven does not work with Agile, as the functionality of these increments is not planned in advance, but during development. Thus make a flexible plan that can accommodate the changes (from development side or customer side).

### Agile planning stages
- Release planning: looks ahead for several months and decides on features that should be included in a release.
- Iteration planning: shorter term, focuses on planning the next increment (usually 2-4 weeks).

## Story-based planning
The system specification in XP is based on user stories. Project members rank the stories in order of the amount of time they think it will take to implement the story.
Release planning involves selecting and refining the stories that will reflect the features to be implemented in a release of a system and the order in which the stories should be implemented.

## Key points
- The price charged does not just depend on its estimated development costs, it may be adjusted depending on the market and organizational priorities.
- Plan-driven development is organized around a complete project plan that defines the project activities, the planned effort, the activity schedule and who is responsible for each activity.
- In agile management, the plan is developed incrementally and adjusted if required. Software functionality is reduced instead of delaying delivery of an increment.
