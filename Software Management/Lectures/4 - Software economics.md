## Fundamental parameters
Five fundamental parameters that can be abstracted from software costing models:
- Size
- Process
- Personnel
- Environment
- Required Quality

### Size
Usually measured in SLOC (better later in the project) or number of Function Points (better earlier in project). Four ISO standards on how to count function points: IFPUG, NESMA, FISMA, COSMIC.

### Process
The guiding process for all activities. Significant movement towards 'lean'.

### Personnel
Capabilities of the personnel in general and in the specific application domain. Get the right people, if possible. Specialization is good, but also expensive. Team work is everything.

### Environment
Tools and techniques used to support the development effort (testings, bug tracking, etc.).

### Required Quality
The functionality provided, performance, reliability, maintainability, portability, UI, etc...

## Effort
$$Effort = (personnel)(environment)(quality)(size)$$
Effort is exponentially related to size: 10,000 LOC will cost less per line than a 100,000 LOC application. This is a proven fact. Additional communications involved is very significant.

These days better economies of scale because:
- Applications live for years
- Common architectures, framework, processes, etc. High initial overhead, but follow-on efforts have much better ROI

## Estimating cost problems
Little is available on estimating cost for projects using iterative development.using iterative development.
- Difficult to hold all the controls constant
	- Application domain; project size; criticality; etc. Very 'artsy'.  
	- Metrics (SLOC, function points, etc.NOT consistently applied EVEN in the same application domain!
	- Definitions of SLOC and function points are not even consistent!!
- Much of this is due to the nature of development.Much of this is due to the nature of development. There is no magic date when design is 'done'; or magic date when testing 'begins'...

A plan and cost estimation is CRITICAL to budgets, resource allocation and to a host of stakeholders.

## Project planning
A project plan, created at the start of the project has:
- Breaking down the work into parts
- Assigning to team members
- Anticipate problems and prepare tentative solutions
This plan is used to communicate how the work will be done to the project team, customers and help assess progress. Doing this well is the task of the project manager.
