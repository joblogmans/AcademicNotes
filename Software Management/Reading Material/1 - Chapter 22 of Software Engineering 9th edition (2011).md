Reading material for lecture 1.
Ian Sommerville (2011), Software Engineering, 9th Edition, **Chapter 22**

Objectives of the chapter:
- Know the principal tasks of software project managers;
- The notion of risk management and some of the risks that can arise in software projects;
- Understand factors that influence personal motivation and what these might mean for software project managers;
- Understand key issues that influence team working, such as team composition, organization, and communication.

Important goals usually are:
1. Deliver the software to the customer at the agreed time.
2. Keep overall costs within budget.
3. Deliver software that meets the customer’s expectations.
4. Maintain a happy and well-functioning development team.

Software engineering is different from other engineering project:
1. The product is intangible. Hard to show progress.
2. Large software projects are often 'one-off' projects. Problems are not easily anticipated with previous experience.
3. Software processes are variable and organization-specific.

Most managers take responsibility for (some of) these activities:
1. Project planning - planning, estimating, scheduling, task divisions, etc.
2. Reporting - communicate with higher-ups and stakeholders.
3. Risk management - assess, monitor and take action if required.
4. People management - choose people and choose ways of working that lead to performance.
5. Proposal writing - writing a proposal to win a contract or convince higher-ups.

Categories of risk:
1. Project risk - risks that affect the project schedule or resources.
2. Product risk - risks that affect the quality or performance. E.g. purchased component not functioning as required.
3. Business risk - risks that affect the organization developing. E.g. competitor introducing new product.

Outline of risk management:
1. Risk identification You should identify possible project, product, and business risks.
2. Risk analysis You should assess the likelihood and consequences of these risks.
3. Risk planning You should make plans to address the risk, either by avoiding it or minimizing its effects on the project.
4. Risk monitoring You should regularly assess the risk and your plans for risk mitigation and revise these when you learn more about the risk.

Risk checklist (can be used as a starting point):
1. Technology risks: Risks that derive from the software or hardware technologies that are used to develop the system.
2. People risks: Risks that are associated with the people in the development team.
3. Organizational risks: Risks that derive from the organizational environment where the software is being developed.
4. Tools risks: Risks that derive from the software tools and other support software used to develop the system.
5. Requirements risks: Risks that derive from changes to the customer requirements and the process of managing the requirements change.
6. Estimation risks: Risks that derive from the management estimates of the resources required to build the system.

Ways to deal with risk:
1. Avoidance strategies Following these strategies means that the probability that the risk will arise will be reduced.
2. Minimization strategies Following these strategies means that the impact of the risk will be reduced.
3. Contingency plans Following these strategies means that you are prepared for the worst and have a strategy in place to deal with it.

Risk monitoring is the process of checking that your assumptions about the product, process, and business risks have not changed. You should regularly assess each of the identified risks to decide whether or not that risk is becoming more or less probable.

Factors in people management:
1. Consistency: People in a project team should all be treated in a comparable way. No one expects all rewards to be identical but people should not feel that their contribution to the organization is undervalued.
2. Respect: Different people have different skills and managers should respect these differences. All members of the team should be given an opportunity to make a contribution.
3. Inclusion: People contribute effectively when they feel that others listen to them and take account of their proposals. It is important to develop a working environment where all views, even those of the most junior staff, are considered.
4. Honesty: As a manager, you should always be honest about what is going well and what is going badly in the team. You should also be honest about your level of technical knowledge and willing to defer to staff with more knowledge when necessary.

Personality also influences motivation, three proposed types:
1. Task-oriented people, who are motivated by the work they do. In software engineering, these are people who are motivated by the intellectual challenge of software development.  
2. Self-oriented people, who are principally motivated by personal success and recognition. They are interested in software development as a means of achieving their own goals. They often have longer-term goals, such as career progression, that motivate them and they wish to be successful in their work to help realize these goals.
3. Interaction-oriented people, who are motivated by the presence and actions of co-workers. As software development becomes more user-centered, interaction-oriented individuals are becoming more involved in software engineering.

As a general rule, software engineering groups should not have more than 10 members. Putting together a group that has the correct balance of skills, experience and personalities is a critical management task. 
Benefits from a cohesive group:
1. The group can establish its own quality standards: Because these standards are established by consensus, they are more likely to be observed than external standards imposed on the group.  
2. Individuals learn from and support each other: People in the group learn from each other. Inhibitions caused by ignorance are minimized as mutual learning is encouraged.  
3. Knowledge is shared: Continuity can be maintained if a group member leaves. Others in the group can take over critical tasks and ensure that the project is not unduly disrupted.  
4. Refactoring and continual improvement is encouraged: Group members work collectively to deliver high-quality results and fix problems, irrespective of the individuals who originally created the design or program.

A group that has complementary personalities may work better than a group that is selected solely on technical ability. People who are motivated by the work are likely to be the strongest technically. People who are self-oriented will probably be best at pushing the work forward to finish the job. People who are interaction-oriented help facilitate communications within the group. I think that it is particularly important to have interaction-oriented people in a group. They like to talk to people and can detect tensions and disagreements at an early stage, before these have a serious impact on the group.
