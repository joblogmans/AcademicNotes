Software is easily reproduced, therefore it has been decided to offer IP protection fo software. However, only the source- and object code are protected. The concept and/or function is not protected.
The European patent system excludes computer programs and business methods from patentability. This is specific to Europe, and some argue this puts Europe at a competitive disadvantage when compared to the US or Japan.

There are several issues with software patents:
- Cumulative, sequential development
- Re-use of others work
- The need to preserve interoperability between systems

Patenting of business methods (i.e. the function that a piece of software fulfills) is also difficult:
- Abstract
- Mental processes are generally not patentable
- The relation between the process and the software is not always clear
