# Baselining
- Monitoring as-is performance
- Measuring trends in performance
- Drawing conclusions
You get what you measure.

Baselining is classical risk management.
Technical state compliance monitoring.
# CIS
Centre for Internet Security. Pro-bono organisation for consensus-driven best practices. List of items to go through when developing and deploying.
1. Not the same as scope
2. CIS looks at IT security fixes, not organizational risk

Cyber security: its not the destination, but the journey.

# What is the most efficient way of determining your security controls?
Goeie vraag, wil ik ook wel weten.

# What about Threat Modelling?
Set limits to what you model.

Gross risk: risk with no protection.
Net risk: risk after your protections.

# Measuring
## Process
Most companies run weekly or monthly scans on TSCM.
Cloud based implementations can do this much more often.
Measurement in TSCM is binary - so is the outcome.
## Outcome
Most companies happy with 99,8% compliance. However, the 0,2% could be the mission critical part while 80% of the compliance is irrelevant.

Keep in mind that things such as TSCM do not include measures that impact function.

# What should you include in baselining/TSCM efforts?
Expensive ideas -> lower chance of implementation. Verder zegt hij alleen dat er soms niks gebeurt met adviezen...
