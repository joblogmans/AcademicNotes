Innovation is a set of components:
- business process
- permanent setting requirements
- production process requirements
- industrial and market changes
- combination of the cognitive population

Business model innovation might even become more important than product/service innovation.

The adoption of a new system usually implies fully or partly replacing a current system, thus resistance is often manifested as failure of a user to shift from a current technology to a newly introduced one. Therefore, a potential source of resistance to adopting a new system lies in the use of a current system.

Some consider organizational inertia the most important factor preventing recognition of setting threats for the organization and adaption to the threat.

Some definitions of organizational inertia:
- a phenomenon of stagnant organization, and it reflects the excessively stable condition of products, production methods, and policies of an organization
- Organizational inertia is the organization’s ability to make internal changes in the face of significant external changes. When inertia gradually occurs in the organization’s actions, the organization automatically reacts based on past experiences and strongly resists against changing

Two types of organizational inertia:
- resource inflexibility which suggests the company’s failure to change the patterns of investing the resources
- and routine inflexibility which implies no change in organizational processes and the procedures of using the invested resources

Types of inertia:
- insight inertia: a lack of understanding of the organization's environmental changes
- psychological inertia: members of the organization resist change leads to psychological inertia
- action inertia: slow decision making by management, or inadequate information gathered for decision making
- structural inertia: occurs when an organization cannot change its processes
- economic inertia: occurs when the finances of changing are costly or complicated
- organizational imprinting: the initial conditions of founding the organization still have a profound impact on how processes are viewed by the organization
- path dependance: imprinting, but then for all decisions made so far (sticking to decisions from the past for example)
- Commitment and sunk cost: self explanatory
- Institutional persistence: *wtf is deze paper? dat is geen antwoord op hun eigen vraag!? Zie tweede helft 3e pagina*
