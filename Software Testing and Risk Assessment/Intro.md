# What is risk?
For the purposes of this course: "the effect of uncertainty on objectives (ISO 31000 (2009))".

Two main ingredients:
- (Negative) impact
- Uncertainty

Four risk strategies:
- Tolerate
- Terminate (just stop doing the activity that has the risk)
- Treat (reduce the likelihood or impact)
- Transfer (to someone else)
