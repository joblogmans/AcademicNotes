"Data is garbage".

Aim of the course:
identify and prevent cyber crime using machine learning. Use anything that works and adapt it to cyber data.

## Classic ML fails in cybersec
- Large majority (>99%) of cases are benign
- Data is sequential
- Data is massive and keeps coming in
- Opponent learns
- Data frequently comes from people -> low quality
- Output needs to be anonymized, but still readable by analysts
