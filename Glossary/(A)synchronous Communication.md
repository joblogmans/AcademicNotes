# (A)synchronous Communication
## Asynchronous Communication
Communication that does not require a common clock to synchronize. This requires additional information to be transmitted, resulting in a lower throughput than with [[Synchronous Communication#Synchronous Communication|synchronous communication]], but also doesn't require an additional form of communication (e.g. a wire).

## Synchronous Communication
Communication which uses a common clock to synchronize. Thus no synchronization information needs to be transmitted which gives a higher throughput than with [[(A)synchronous Communication#A ynchronous Communication|asynchronous communication]]. This does require an additional form of communication to share the clock, e.g. a wire.
